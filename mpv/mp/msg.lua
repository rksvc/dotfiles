--- The level parameter is the message priority. It's a string and one of `fatal`,
--- `error`, `warn`, `info`, `v`, `debug`, `trace`. The user's settings will
--- determine which of these messages will be visible. Normally, all messages are
--- visible, except `v`, `debug` and `trace`.
---
--- The parameters after that are all converted to strings. Spaces are inserted to
--- separate multiple parameters.
---
--- You don't need to add newlines.
